 ## :beginner: About

I implemented the bubble,selection sorting algorithm in my JavaScript code and used it to sort a randomly generated array of integers. 
The "randomize" button should be used to generate a new random array of the specified length, and the "Bubble Sort" button should trigger the bubble sorting algorithm ,the "Selection Sort" should trigger the selection sort algorithm and display the sorting process visually on the web page.
